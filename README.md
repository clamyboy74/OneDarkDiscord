# OneDarkDiscord
 A theme based off of One Dark, a theme from Atom. Keeps many of same elements as normal dark theme discord. Also hides extra unused tabs(Nitro, gifts, etc) from the friends tab and chatbar.

Note: As of the April 2025 UI update many changes including the background colros do not work properly. I will hold off on any changes until the changes are noted.
